In this assignment we combined two concepts:
    * Building and serving an API using Express
    * Building a ReactJS front-end that consumes that API

We also created a ReactJS front-end that uses a router. 
The fetch API was used to do:
    * Get requests
    * Post requests
    * Put requests
    * Delete requests 

For this front-end assignment, a json file was used to store data instead of a database.
